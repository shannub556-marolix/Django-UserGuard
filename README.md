# User Authentication and Profile Management System
I developed a comprehensive User Management System using Django, a high-level Python web framework. The system includes features such as user registration, login, profile management, and password reset functionalities with otp Authentication and sms for Successful registration. Leveraging Django's built-in authentication system and REST framework, users can securely register, authenticate, and manage their profiles within the application.

User Registration : Users can register with the system by providing their email, name, password, and confirming the password.
User Login : Registered users can log in by providing their email and password.
Profile Management : Authenticated users can view their profile information, including their unique identifier (ID), email, and name.
User Logout : Logging out blacklists the refresh token, ensuring that it cannot be used for future authentication.
OTP-Based Authentication For Resetting Password : OTPs are sent to users' email addresses for verification during login or specific operations and The system facilitates the secure resetting of passwords by verifying the user's email and ensuring password strength.
